# Philip Slisenko

Software engineer with a big passion for the field. Got my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2019 and have been deeply immersed in the industry ever since. I've been exposed to all sorts of technologies throughout my journey but have mostly excelled in ML and Full Stack domains.

Also, I enjoy working on side projects, the most recent one being [CNL](https://github.com/PhilipSlisenko/cnl)
